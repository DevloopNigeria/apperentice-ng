# apperentice-ng
Here's Apprentice.ng.  A platform that hopes to tackle unemployment and help people acquire valuable technical skills.   The platform connects people to places around them that are partners with Apprentice.ng where they can learn a locally sorted skill trade like tailoring, carpentry,GSM repair etc.   And at the end of learning this skills (depending on how long the contract you signed up for) you would be issued a nationally recognized certification by Apprentice.ng to certify that you have learned that particular skill, and with this certificate you can get employed or startup your own business been backed up by Apprentice.ng...  Skilled trade has been existing for ages but we plan to digitalize it and make it easy for people to get access to it and also placing more value on it.
